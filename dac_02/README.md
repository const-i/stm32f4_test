# DAC - Embassy

DAC example of the Embassy framework: https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy

Code shamelessly taken from: https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/examples/stm32f4

Specifically using a embassy task to generate a sine wave of a specific frequency: 440 Hz

Not getting a sine wave of exactly 440 Hz with this, but it gets close ~430 Hz when built using the --release profile
